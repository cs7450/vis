The SousRated visualization allows you to plan a variety of meals based on the ingredients they share in common. If you're at a loss planning dinner for the week, or don’t know what you can make out of what you have left, we can help!

To get started you will need to choose some ingredients. Click the search bar above and either scroll through and select individual ingredients, type in ingredient names in the search bar, or just select all if you want to see everything. You can also filter recipes based on cuisine type - if you don’t care feel free to leave them all checked.

After the visualization has populated, you’ll see arcs connecting ingredient segments to recipe segments. These arcs show the membership of unique kinds of ingredients to various recipes. The bigger an ingredient segment is, the more recipes it is a part of - a good thing to know if you want something versatile in your pantry. Similarly, large recipe segments tell you it has more required types of ingredients, which you may want to avoid if you want to keep it simple.

Clicking on a specific recipe will populate a scatterplot to the right. Here you can see the the selected recipe and the nine closest recipes (in terms of shared ingredients) compared by serving size and total cooking time. Clicking the recipe title above the scatter plot takes you to the source url where you can find the exact quantities and cooking instructions for your recipe. You can also access recipe urls by clicking data points in the scatterplot.
